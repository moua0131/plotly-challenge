Notes to TAs:

This project was difficult to deploy to Heroku.  I understand the process in concept but the execution is poor.  I think this is my 4th attempt at deploying.
  
Issues faced when working with different tutors was that they had different ideas on how best to push to git vs working on local server then pushing.  Overall, a quite confusing process.  

Still not comfortable with working in terminal and it shows.
